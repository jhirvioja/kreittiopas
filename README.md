# Kreittiopas Next.js Preact Progressive Web App

This is a sandbox/demo/learning project for me personally. A Next.js/Preact pwa for a fictional webzine called Kreittiopas. Its design is based on HSL's Reittiopas, with the following badum-tshh Finnish pun-intended joke: if you add a letter k in front of reittiopas it literally means a "crate guide" in Finnish. No harm done because this is not going to be ever fully materialized as a real project.

[Digging in the crates](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Diggin%27%20in%20the%20Crates) is a cultural phenomenon where dj's and producers (most notably of the hip hop variety) go to flea markets, record stores, etc. and skim through **crates** of records to find musical gems, samples, forgotten tunes. I envisioned this website to be a webzine of some sorts for finding those rare diamonds - letting dj's, producers or music nerds to report them to other users in a blogging fashion.

Usually dj's, for example, just play their findings in a gig somewhere or producers use them in a beat. The background stories are left out. How the record was found from what record store, who is the artist/group, do they have any relevance to anything (or is the record rare?).. any or all of these nerdy spicy details are left out. So the function of this website was imagined to be a collection of liner notes accompanied to musical pieces, to dj's and vinyl collectors, possibly music journalists, who enjoy finding rare and obscure records.

The webzine is armed with the possibility of providing three different varities of content: a post that can be an article, podcast or an ad. It also has an admin panel. For further information, dive deep in to "frontend" and "backend" folders which both have their own README.mds.

**Disclaimer**: bare in mind that when this project was scaffolded and started, I had studied JavaScript for less than three months, React for exactly 0 days. The project also changed its form during development, so the choice of technologies and folder structure do not reflect the ideal situation in any shape or form. It served is purpose though: I learned a bunch of stuff about modern web development.
